# Kern-s-Electronics-Learning-Portfolio
Starts off with the basic math and physics of electronics circuits. Once chapter 1 starts, I will start off  with basic components. Then we will build up to more complex circuits

I will discuss the theory behind the circuits/electronics, then simulate them on LTSpice. I will (later) build these circuits physically on breadboards.
